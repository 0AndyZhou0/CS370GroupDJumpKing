### Goal: Creating a 2D platformer like the ~~rage inducing~~ friendly platformer game Jump King.  

~~Step 1: Learn Unity~~  

Cycle 1 -   
  - Phase 0: DONE  
    * Decide on what form of communication to use (Discord). DONE  
    * Decide on the platform we are going to make the game in (Unity). DONE  
    * Decide how we are going to share files (GitHub). DONE  
    * Decide on what basic game mechanics to implement. DONE  
  
  - Phase 1:   
    * Create a working MVP. DONE  
    * Add the main form of movement, Charge jump. DONE  
    * Add basic mechanic of bouncing off of walls. DONE  
    * Add moving left and right. DONE  
    * Prevent the player from moving left and right when charging a jump. (BUG: Works unless the user presses both buttons simultaneously) FIXED  
    * Start working on assets.  
    * Environment tileset   
    * UI  
    * Character  
    * Finish working on 2 mechanics used in later levels.  
    * Gravity changes  
    * Sloped platforms  
    * Sticky platforms  
    * Bouncy platforms  
    * Moving platforms  
    * Randomized platforms  
    * Start designing early game levels  

  - Phase 2:   
    * Continue designing the early game levels  
    * Finish working on 2 more of the mechanics used in later levels.  
    * Gravity changes  
    * Sloped platforms  
    * Sticky platforms  
    * Bouncy platforms  
    * Moving platforms  
    * Randomized platforms  

  - Phase 3:   
    * Finish working on the early game levels  
    * Finish working on the last 2 of the mechanics used in later levels.  
    * Gravity changes  
    * Sloped platforms  
    * Sticky platforms  
    * Bouncy platforms  
    * Moving platforms  
    * Randomized platforms  



Cycle 2 - Design assets (environment, UI, character, etc), work on early game levels to naturally teach the player but also challenge them a bit   

Cycle 3 - Design and develop mid-game levels that introduce some new mechanics (moving platforms, gravity changes, etc)   

Cycle 4 - Design and develop end-game levels that thoroughly test the playerâ€™s skills
